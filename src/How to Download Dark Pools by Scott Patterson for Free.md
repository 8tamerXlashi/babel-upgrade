Dark Pools is not only a fascinating account of the history and evolution of electronic trading, but also a warning about the potential risks and challenges that it poses for the future. Patterson interviews some of the key players and pioneers in the field, such as Josh Levine, who created Island, one of the first alternative trading systems; Dave Cummings, who founded Tradebot, one of the largest high-frequency trading firms; and Haim Bodek, who exposed the unfair practices and loopholes that some dark pools and exchanges used to favor certain traders over others. He also explores the role of regulators, lawmakers, and watchdogs in overseeing and reforming the market, as well as the impact of events such as the 2008 financial crisis, the 2010 flash crash, and the 2012 Knight Capital debacle.
 
Dark Pools is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand how the stock market works today, and how it might change tomorrow. It is a gripping and eye-opening story that exposes the hidden forces and actors that shape the global economy. It is also a cautionary tale that urges us to be more aware and vigilant of the dangers and pitfalls of relying too much on technology and automation, without proper checks and balances. As Patterson writes in his conclusion: "The machines have taken over. Now we need to watch them very closely."
