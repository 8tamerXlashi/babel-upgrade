## 1. Quickly Whiten Teeth
 
One of the most common tasks in photo editing is whitening teeth. Here's how you can do it in a few simple steps:
 
1. Go to Layer->New Adjustment Layer->Vibrance and reduce the Vibrance to "-60".
2. Next, select the Vibrance layer in the layers panel and specifically choose the layer mask.
3. In the Properties Panel (Window->Properties), select the "Invert" button to fill our mask with black to hide the desaturation that we just imposed on the Vibrance layer.
4. Next, select the Brush tool (B) and grab a small, soft-edged brush and look to the control bar across the top of the screen and set the Opacity to "50%".
5. Paint over the teeth you'd like to whiten for a realistic and beautiful smile!

## 2. Merge All Layers to New Layer
 
Sometimes, you may want to merge all your layers into one layer while still retaining your original layer structure. There is no menu feature to do this in Photoshop, only a hidden hotkey. Here's how:

- Press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Alt/Opt + E. This will combine everything and pop it onto a new layer in one fell swoop.

## 3. The Rotate View Tool
 
When retouching or doing any kind of shading, dodging, or burning, the Rotate View tool is one of the most useful features in Photoshop. This tool will rotate the view of your image, but not actually flip the image. It's quick and easy to use! Here's how:

- Click and hold on the Hand tool in the tool box to reveal the Rotate View tool (R) and then drag side-to-side to rotate the image clockwise or counterclockwise.
- Look to the toolbar and hit the "Reset View" button to instantly level off the image and bring things back to normal.

## 4. Change Layer Opacity Hotkey
 
Instead of using the opacity slider in the layers panel, you can quickly change layer opacity by simply selecting the Move tool (V) and pressing any number on your keyboard. Here's how:

- "1" will set the layer to "10%", "5" will set it to "50%", etc... hit "0" to reset the layer to "100%".
- TIP: Hold down the Shift key and press any number to adjust the fill opacity.
